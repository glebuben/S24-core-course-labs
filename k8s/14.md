Pods are the smallest and simplest Kubernetes objects. They represent a single instance of a running process in the cluster. Each pod encapsulates one or more containers.

**Pods related to the application (Flask App):**
```bash
NAME                                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
...

pod/flask-app-1  
...
```
- **flask-app-0** and **flask-app-1**:
  - These containers host instances of the Flask application.

- **prometheus-grafana-d5679d5d7-ndsh6**:
  - This container hosts the Grafana component of the Prometheus stack.
  - Grafana is used for visualization and monitoring dashboard creation.
  - It allows users to create custom dashboards to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus, providing insights into the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster and applications.

- **prometheus-kube-prometheus-operator-86b45bb85b-b7kfk**:
  - This container hosts the kube-prometheus operator, responsible for managing the Prometheus stack components.
  - The operator simplifies the deployment and management of Prometheus and related components within the Kubernetes cluster, automating tasks such as scaling, updates, and configuration.

- **prometheus-kube-state-metrics-547454f49d-p7ntb**:
  - This container hosts kube-state-metrics, which generates metrics about the state of various Kubernetes objects.
  - Kube-state-metrics provides metrics about nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes resources, which can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

- **prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0**:
  - This container hosts the Prometheus server component, responsible for collecting, storing, and querying metrics from monitored targets.
  - Prometheus collects metrics from various sources and allows users to create custom alerting rules and queries to monitor the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster.

- **prometheus-prometheus-node-exporter-785zg**:
  - This container hosts node-exporter, a Prometheus exporter that collects system-level metrics from Kubernetes nodes.
  - Node-exporter collects metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk utilization, and network statistics from each node in the cluster, providing insights into the overall health and performance of the infrastructure.

**Pods related to Vault:**
```bash
NAME                                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
...
pod/vault-0                                                  1/1     Running   3 (20m ago)   20d
pod/vault-agent-injector-dbfc5cd77-b6xm4                     1/1     Running   3 (20m ago)   20d
```
These pods are presented, because of one of the previous labs. They were used to manage secrets.
- **vault-0**:
  - This container hosts the main Vault instance, a tool for managing secrets and sensitive data within the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Vault provides a secure way to store and access sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and encryption keys, ensuring that they are securely managed and accessed by authorized applications and users.

- **vault-agent-injector-dbfc5cd77-b6xm4**:
  - This container hosts the Vault agent injector, which facilitates injecting Vault secrets into Kubernetes pods.
  - The Vault agent injector automates the process of injecting secrets into applications running in Kubernetes, ensuring secure access to sensitive data without exposing it in configuration files or environment variables.

#### Statefulsets
```bash
NAME                                                                    READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/alertmanager-prometheus-kube-prometheus-alertmanager   1/1     15m
statefulset.apps/flask-app                                              2/2     6d19h

```
StatefulSets are a valuable resource for managing stateful applications and ensuring their availability and reliability within a Kubernetes environment. They provide unique identities for each pod and stable, persistent storage.


**StatefulSets related to the application (Flask App):**
```bash
NAME                                                                    READY   AGE
