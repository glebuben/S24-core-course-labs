# Best Practices Implemented

## Use of Encrypted Secrets
GitHub secrets were utilized to securely store credentials (e.g., DOCKER_TOKEN or SNYK_TOKEN), ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in plain text.

## Explicitly Defined Workflow Triggers
The workflow is triggered on push events, ensuring that it runs when changes are pushed to the repository.

## Code Linting
Code quality is checked using the flake8 linting system.

## Security Checks
Security vulnerabilities are checked using Snyk.

## Separation of Concerns with Multiple Jobs
The workflow is divided into multiple jobs (build_test, security, lint, and docker), each responsible for a specific task. This separation allows for better organization, parallel execution, and easier debugging.

## Dependency Caching for Python Dependencies
Python dependencies are cached using the actions/cache action, improving build times by reusing previously installed dependencies when possible.

## Cache Utilization for Docker Layers
Docker layers are cached to speed up image builds using the actions/cache action, reducing the need to rebuild unchanged layers.

## Use of Community Actions
Existing GitHub Actions from the GitHub Marketplace (actions/checkout, actions/setup-python, snyk/actions, docker/login-action, docker/setup-buildx-action, docker/cache, docker/build-push-action) were utilized for common tasks such as checking out code, setting up Python, running security checks with Snyk, linting with Flake8, and building and pushing Docker images.

## Conditional Execution with Needs
The docker job specifies dependencies on the lint and security jobs using the `needs` keyword. This ensures that the docker job only runs after the lint and security jobs have completed successfully, helping to enforce code quality and security checks before deploying Docker images.
