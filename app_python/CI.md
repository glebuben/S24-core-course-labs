# Best Practices Implemented

## Explicitly Defined Workflow Triggers
The workflow is triggered on `push` events, ensuring that it runs when changes are pushed to the repository.

## Separation of Concerns with Multiple Jobs
The workflow is divided into multiple jobs (`build_test`, `security`, `lint`, and `docker`), each responsible for a specific task. This separation allows for better organization, parallel execution, and easier debugging.

## Dependency Caching for Python Dependencies
The workflow includes a step to cache Python dependencies using the `actions/cache` action. Caching dependencies helps improve build times by reusing previously installed dependencies when possible.

## Use of Community Actions
The workflow utilizes existing GitHub Actions from the GitHub Marketplace (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`, `snyk/actions`, `docker/login-action`, `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `docker/cache`, `docker/build-push-action`) for common tasks such as checking out code, setting up Python, running security checks with Snyk, linting with Flake8, and building and pushing Docker images.

## Conditional Execution with `needs`
The `docker` job specifies dependencies on the `lint` and `security` jobs using the `needs` keyword. This ensures that the `docker` job only runs after the `lint` and `security` jobs have completed successfully, helping to enforce code quality and security checks before deploying Docker images.

## Cache Utilization for Docker Layers
The Docker job includes caching for Docker layers using the `actions/cache` action. Caching Docker layers helps speed up image builds by reusing layers from previous builds, reducing the need to rebuild unchanged layers.
