"""
Unit Tests Documentation for Flask Web App

This module contains unit tests for the functions and routes implemented in the
Flask web app that displays the current time in Moscow. The tests are designed
 to verify the correctness and functionality of the app's core features.

Requirements:
    - Flask: Ensure Flask is installed (pip install Flask)
    - pytz: Ensure pytz is installed (pip install pytz)

Note:
    - These tests assume that the Flask app is running correctly and the
    HTML template is properly set up.
    - It's recommended to run the tests in a controlled environment, as they
     may interact with external dependencies such as the current time and
      Flask routes.
