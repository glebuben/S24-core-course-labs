A simple Flask web app that displays the current time in Moscow.

This web app uses Flask to create a single route that renders an HTML template.
The current time in Moscow is calculated using the pytz library.

Requirements:
    - Flask: pip install Flask
    - pytz: pip install pytz

Usage:
    1. Save this script as 'app.py'.
    2. Create a 'templates' folder in the same directory.
    3. Save the HTML template as 'index.html' in the 'templates' folder.
    4. Run the script: python app.py
    5. Open browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to view the Moscow time.

Note:
    Make sure to have an HTML template named 'index.html' with appropriate
     placeholders.
